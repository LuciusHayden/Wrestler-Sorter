Takes a few statistics for wrestlers, normalizes the data and pairs them together, the data set is currently created by chat gpt and not a real data set, but you get the idea. Takes wrestlers with different weights, ages, and levels of experience and pairs them together based on those. Idea comes from Stanford wrestling match days, where many people go to Stanford to wrestle a few people. This would take the people who signed up and would pair them together to hopefully save some time and lead to more effective pairings.
